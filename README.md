Inventory Management Project
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing inventory data to gain insights into inventory trends. It involves merging data from two datasets - ```Inventory Dataset.xlsx``` and ```New Inventory.xlsx```. The resulting merged dataset is used to create visualizations showcasing inventory levels and new arrivals over time.

## Data Description
```Inventory Dataset.xlsx```: Contains information about existing inventory.
```New Inventory.xlsx```: Provides data on new inventory arrivals.

## Data Merging
The two datasets are merged based on the ```'Item Number'``` column, creating a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

## Data Visualization
The project includes visualizations such as:

Total Item Qty in Inventory for Each Month: Bar chart displaying the total item quantity in inventory for each month.

Total Item Qty Received to Inventory in Each Month: Line chart and bar chart illustrating the total item quantity received in each month.

Combined Chart: A combination of line and bar charts providing a comprehensive view of inventory trends.

## Insights
The visualizations highlight trends, such as increased inventory additions in October-November and lower levels in June. The year-end peak in on-hand inventory emphasizes the significance of year-end inventory management.

## Files
